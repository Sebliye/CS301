        <p> Born and raised in Ethiopia, Addis abeba. A beautiful city and generous people around me.<br>
        I have 4 sisters and 1 brother. My brother is my love. There is no body like him. He really <br>
        loves and care for his sisters. My familes are bussiness peoples. They don't have much time <br>
        for us but its good that we are a lot of siblings so that we don't get bored.My father is a brave <br> 
        man. we grow up respecting him. He guides us in the right direction of our life and he can fofrcast <br>
        our future from our potential. He always used to tell me that i should be a doctor.Either a medical <br>
        doctor or doctorate in any field of study. This is my second masters and he is very proud of me as i<br>
         am very proud ofmy self. I feel like investing on my self is one of the biggest decision i took.</p>
