        <h3> <u>How i came up with the idea</u></h3>
       <p> Maharishi university students take there coding exam on paper. I imaged the teaching assistant and <br>
        teacher doing a lot of work checking the code line by line.This software makes the teachers life easier. </p
        <h3> <u>How does my idea solve the problem</u> </h3> 
        <P>The only thing the teachers need to do is scan the paper.The code will run on the software and will <br>
             give feedback where they make mistake. It will also grade the work but, the teacher has to input the 
             percentage.<br>
             This bussiness is only idea but, with the javascript class i can make it happen. </p>
